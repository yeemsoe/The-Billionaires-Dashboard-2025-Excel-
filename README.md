#  The Billionaires Dashboard 2025 (Excel)


**Figures in millions of USD**

An interactive Excel dashboard providing insights into global billionaire wealth distribution across regions, industries, countries, and demographics.


## Business Problem

Billionaire wealth is highly concentrated, but the drivers of this concentration—such as **industry, geography, self-made status, and demographics**—are not immediately visible in raw data.

This project answers the key business question:

**What factors most strongly influence global billionaire wealth concentration, and where is that wealth distributed?**
